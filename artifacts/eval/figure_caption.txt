Figure X — Comparative evaluation of Maya-3x against Maya-1x and a Baseline Agent across production-oriented metrics. Metrics include task completion and recovery rates (durability), local processing ratio (privacy-first behavior), memory retrieval effectiveness (GraphRAG), security detection accuracy, and average end-to-end latency for multimodal interactions. Results are aggregated over standardized test suites described in the Methods section.
